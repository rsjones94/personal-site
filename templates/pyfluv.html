	    	<p style="text-align: left;">Pyfluv is a Python package for the analysis of restoration geomorphology. Initially intended to serve as a programmatic way to analyze the data collected during routine monitoring of stream restoration projects, its scope has expanded to include novel techniques to autonomously identify interesting geomorphological features, allowing researchers and practitioners to quickly analyze huge datasets.</p>
