	    	<p style="text-align: left;">
	    		<i>ecotrajectory</i> is a Python package that simulates an ecosystem populated by herbivores and carnivores. Both populations respond to one another, and occasional genetic mutations force adapations in the community. Sometimes interesting competetive strategies emerge, and sometimes one population so severely outcompetes the other that an extinction occurrs.</p>
	    	<p style="text-align: left;">
	    		You can technically <b>pip install ecotrajectory</b> right now, but the version indexed by PyPi isn't functional. You can grab a copy of the development branch from my Github or check back later.
